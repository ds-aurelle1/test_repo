# The room analysis coding challenge

### Review and analysis of Business questions

The goal of this coding challenge is to analyze course performance and the sample dataset used from udemy courses

   (a) Business question: Did the duration range impact the course adoption?

After setting the course duration ranges, we can see in [Impact of duration range on course adoption](https://public\
.tableau.com/app/profile/aurelle/viz/Aurelle-theroomAnalysis/Coursesadoption#1) that the shorter the course duration range, the more we have more subscribers. We can therefore say that the duration range closely impacts the adoption of courses. Subscribers are much more interested in these courses that are short or small, quickly digestible course videos, so the shorter the duration of the course, the greater the number of subscribers.

   (b) Business question: Are the courses well designed at level of difficulty?

When we look at this [global summary](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Aurelle-theroomAnalysis/question2bcoursesbylevel#1), we can note that in general, there are few people in high level of difficulty courses. There are 58.81% so more than half subscribers in all levels courses, 34.46% of student base at beginner level courses, and less than 10% in other level.

Going down into details, let us see in [top courses](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Aurelle-theroomAnalysis/question\
2btopcourses#1) that there is a high percentage of students in the basic or beginner courses or all levels while there are very few in the difficult levels. For example, a course like Options Trading 3: Advanced Stock Profit and Success Method has very few students while courses like Coding for Entrepreneurs Basic have more students so the courses reflect the level of difficulty
